Image Processing
================
This projects intent is to revisit image processing algorithms for line detection and pattern recognition in images.
I have also been trying to use features from Java 8-9 to bring my self up to date on these processes. The goal of
this project is to be able to detect significant features of a face and hopefully be able to identify likely faces
in an image.
